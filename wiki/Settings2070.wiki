|| _Pause timer on screen lock and on logoff_ || When you lock your screen or logoff, stop and save the timer. When logging in again the timer will continue. ||
|| _Popup window when minimized_ || Popup the application again after N minutes to trigger the user to check he is still working on the same issue or to commit the current time and start a new working period.<br>The popup timer will start when the window is minimized, so the application will popup N minutes after minimization. ||
